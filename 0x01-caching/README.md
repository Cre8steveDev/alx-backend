# Project Directory: 0x01-caching

This project directory focuses on caching and cache replacement policies. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of caching systems and various cache replacement policies.

## Resources

Before diving into the project, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [Cache replacement policies - FIFO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#First-in-first-out_(FIFO)>)
- [Cache replacement policies - LIFO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Last-in-first-out_(LIFO)>)
- [Cache replacement policies - LRU](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)>)
- [Cache replacement policies - MRU](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Most_recently_used_(MRU)>)
- [Cache replacement policies - LFU](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least-frequently_used_(LFU)>)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without relying on external resources:

- What a caching system is
- What FIFO means (First-In, First-Out)
- What LIFO means (Last-In, First-Out)
- What LRU means (Least Recently Used)
- What MRU means (Most Recently Used)
- What LFU means (Least Frequently Used)
- The purpose of a caching system
- The limitations of a caching system

Let's dive into the world of caching and enhance your understanding of cache replacement policies!
